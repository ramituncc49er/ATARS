You will be given as input a sentence from a hair salon review. Read the sentence and determine if it contains aspects that are atypical for a hair salon. An aspect is considered atypical if it is not related to hair salon business, otherwise the aspect is considered typical. For example, typical aspects include service, location, price, discounts, policies, staff, customer satisfaction, parking, typical hair salon ambience or any other feature commonly associated with a hair salon. No matter how extraordinary or novel an aspect is, if it is an instance or a type of typical aspect, it should not be considered atypical. For example, "fishtail braiding" is not an atypical aspect, because it is still a type of hair styling, and hair stying are typical aspects of a hair salon. On the contrary, a "hair donation campaign for cancer victims" would be an atypical aspect, because it is not part of the hair salon business.

Atypical aspects need to be features of the hair salon. Therefore, sentiment or opinions expressed by customers in the review do not qualify as atypical aspects, nor do similes, analogies, metaphors, or random events involving patrons. Examine not only the aspect itself but also its context within the review to determine whether it is genuinely an atypical feature of the hair salon. Atypical aspects can be events that the hair salon is known to offer from infrequently or on special occasions.

Please be precise in your response. Output <pos> for sentences that contain one or more atypical aspects, then list the atypical aspects. Output <neg> for sentences that do not contain any atypical aspect, then write <None>.
