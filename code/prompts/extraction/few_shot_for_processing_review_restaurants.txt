Example 1:

A bit of self care and indulgence for when you want to relax and de-stress and if you don't want to go to the bar but have another option. Relax and enjoy. There's a lounge area behind. So you can take your drink in the lounge and kick back. Caffeinated choices are available. If you like your tastebuds teased in a different way, this is a treat. Perfect for yogis and if you like incense. (there's no incense, but it may remind you ...). Can be a spiritual experience as there are symbolism and custom associations provided if you want to try them. Just ask the very knowledgeable Server. It is what you make it. Whatever style makes you comfortable. You have to go inside the West Market to find it! Do not miss.

Example 2:

Really good sushi - in a strip mall in Bristol. Go figure. They have hibachi as well, but I feel like hibachi food is hibachi food no matter where you go; it's more about the performance. Do it once and then keep coming back for the sushi! This is a mom-and-pop type restaurant with a friendly atmosphere. If you're there for a special occasion, they'll take a polaroid and add it to their wall. I have fond memories of many family meals here. Look for my picture on the wall; I'm the adorable one.

Example 3:

A bit high priced, and the food is overall good, but not amazing. Still, I really enjoyed myself here probably because I just love sitting at a place on the water (even if the road is right nearby). The place seems large and mostly outdoors. It's a casual fun atmosphere and boaters can come right up to dock. You can also bring your pets! In fact, I saw one guy who brought his parakeet on his shoulder! lol we had some tasty frozen drinks, that either hid the alcohol taste very well with all the sweetness or it was lacking enough alcohol. I'm not sure which, but kinda leaning towards the latter. They have a few beers on tap, but may not be familiar with them. For example, our waitress didn't know that there are several types of Sam Adams beers when I asked which one was on tap. I had the stuffed flounder for my main course and ate every bite. However, I could have been better with less sauce on it. My stomach hurt from all that afterwards I think. We tried the fried cheesecake for dessert...it was okay. Nothing exciting. If you're looking for a leisurely dinner outside while enjoying the Florida atmosphere, this is your place. I wouldn't say no to going back!
