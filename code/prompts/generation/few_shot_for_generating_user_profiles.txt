Example 1: The given topics are <professional babysitting service>

Let's think step by step about how to write a good biography for an individual using the given topic. Here, the given topic can be more effectively integrated as a lifestyle need. We can begin by discussing the individual's family background. As the topic relates to 'babysitting', it's pertinent to mention that the individual has a young child. Next, we can highlight her profession. To make the biography sound well-rounded and natural, we can choose an educational and professional background unrelated to the given topic. Let's place it within the domain of business management and add her current profession to be an operations manager. Now, we can outline situations that logically necessitate the need for a babysitter or babysitting service, such as her desire to go out but being unable to find a babysitter. Thus, we explicitly integrate the given topic into the narrative, aligning it with the individual's lifestyle needs, and also underscoring the usefulness of the given topic for the individual.

So, a good biography would be: "Maria Gonzalez resides in San Diego, California, with her husband and their 7-year-old son. She works as an operations manager. Maria met her husband in college, where she graduated with a major in business management. Maria loves being social and enjoys spending time with her husband and friends, often sharing gossip over a glass of wine. But finding time to get together is hard because of her job. Even weekends, which could be a break, are difficult. Her son is too young to be left by himself, and finding reliable babysitters in her area is tough."

Example 2: The given topics are <yoga>

Let's think step by step about how to write a good biography for an individual using the given topics. Here, the given topic can be more effectively integrated as a hobby. We express the topic 'yoga' as given. We can begin by discussing the individual's educational and professional background. Let's place it within the domain of social studies, adding that this led him to study South Asian cultures and be introduced to yoga. We can then highlight that this interest evolved into a hobby, thus explicitly integrating the given topic into the narrative and aligning it with the individual's hobbies and passions. This approach not only enriches the biography but also underscores the interest or appeal that the individual would feel toward the given topic. We can also mention where he grew up and that he enjoys spending time with his friends and family, which is something unrelated to the given topic, but it contributes to a natural-sounding biography.

So, a good biography would be: "Jordan Lee is a cultural studies lecturer in the college, where he graduated with a major in anthropology. He grew up in Portland with his 2 other siblings, with whom he maintains a very close relationship. Jordan discovered yoga & meditation while doing a study on South Asian cultures. It quickly evolved from a hobby to more of a lifestyle. He enjoys spending time with his friends and family."

We can begin by exploring the individual's upbringing and family history, highlighting that as the eldest of four children, he took over his family's plumbing business. Although these details are unrelated to the given topic, they provide essential background and contribute to a natural-sounding biography. Next, we mention his hobbies, which are playing video games and indoor games, also emphasizing that these activities are not only personal interests but also part of traditional game nights in his household. By doing so, we explicitly integrate the given topic into the narrative, aligning it with the individual's hobbies and also underscoring the interest or appeal that the individual would feel toward the given topics.

Let's think step by step about how to write a good biography for an individual using the given topics. Here, since there are multiple topics with similar themes, we express these through a more general category i.e., the topics 'water, boaters, peacocks, sunset, park woods, long public dock' with 'nature and the outdoors'. This can be more effectively integrated as hobbies. We can start by exploring the individual's upbringing, choosing a location close to nature to implicitly integrate the given topics into the narrative and aligning it with the potential hobbies and passions of the individual, such as hiking and trekking. To add depth, we'll incorporate a significant recent life event that is relevant, further underscoring the interest or appeal that the individual would feel toward the given topics. Additionally, for the given topic 'your pets', we can mention that she owns a cat, implicitly integrating her affection for pets into the biography narrative as well. We can also note her enjoyment of spending time with her friends and family and watching movies, details that are unrelated to the given topics, but contribute to a natural-sounding biography.

We begin by exploring the individual's upbringing, mentioning that he resides in San Francisco where he and his mother run a coffee shop, a local favorite within the community. This detail ties his current profession into the narrative. We then highlight his passion for painting portraits, thus explicitly integrating the given topic into the narrative, aligning it with the individual's hobbies and passions, and also underscoring the interest or appeal that the individual would feel toward the given topics. Additionally, we can delve further into his family history, mentioning that he lost his father at a young age and is very close to his childhood friends. We can conclude by noting his love for foreign films and hosting movie nights with these friends. Although these details would be unrelated to the given topic, they provide essential background and contribute to a natural-sounding biography.

So, a good biography would be: "Jamal lives in San Francisco where he and his mother run a coffee shop, a local favorite among the community.

Example 6: The given topics are <canoeing, kayaking, sunny fish, deck, beautiful garden, hummingbirds, songbirds>

Let's think step by step about how to write a good biography for an individual using the given topics.

Next, we can mention his passion for adventure sports and explicitly integrate the given topic into the narrative, aligning it with the individual's hobbies and passions and also underscoring the interest or appeal that the individual would feel toward the given topics. But we still have some topics to cover. Since we identified journalism as his profession, it would be fitting to introduce photography as one of his passions.

Thus, we can implicitly integrate the remaining given topics 'sunny fish, beautiful garden, hummingbirds' into the narrative as a wildlife photographer can be reasonably expected to enjoy taking pictures of hummingbirds and sunny fishes. Additionally, we can mention that he likes to spend his time mentoring aspiring journalists and photographers, an activity unrelated to the given topics, but which complements the established narrative and enriches his background, ensuring the biography feels well-rounded and natural.

He is also passionate about photography and skillfully merges his journalistic instincts with wildlife photography. Alan's talent for photography has led him to explore distant natural areas, using his photos to show conservation needs through his lens.

Here, since there are multiple topics with a similar theme, we express these through a more general category i.e, the topics 'dance floor, salsa, bachata, merengue, cha cha cha dancers, dance lesson' with 'dance and dancing'. This can be more effectively integrated as a hobby. We can begin by exploring the individual's upbringing and family history, highlighting that she is from New Orleans, where she resides with her parents and brother.

Example 9: The given topics are <panoramic view of the beach>

Let's think step by step about how to write a good biography for an individual using the given topics. Here, we can try not to quote the given topic verbatim and instead explore related concepts that allow us to integrate the topic implicitly, aligning it with the individual's hobbies or passions.  It would be fitting to assume that someone who has a passion for marine photography would also relish spending time at the beach or appreciating its panoramic views. There exists a natural connection or affinity. Let's begin by discussing the individual's current profession and hometown, selecting a location away from coastal cities, and highlighting their preference for traveling to destinations close to the ocean, for instance, a software engineer from Denver, Colorado with a deep passion for marine photography. We are, thus, implicitly integrating the given topic into the narrative.

These details enrich his story, ensuring the biography is well-rounded and natural.

So, a good biography would be: "Tom is a software developer from the bustling city of Denver, Colorado. His day-to-day life revolves around coding and developing applications for tech startups.
