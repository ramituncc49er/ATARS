Do it once and then keep coming back for the sushi! This is a mom-and-pop type restaurant with a friendly atmosphere. If you're there for a special occasion, they'll take a polaroid and add it to their wall. I have fond memories of many family meals here. Look for my picture on the wall; I'm the adorable one.\n",

      "A bit high priced, and the food is overall good, but not amazing. Still, I really enjoyed myself here probably because I just love sitting at a place on the water (even if the road is right nearby). The place seems large and mostly outdoors. It's a casual fun atmosphere and boaters can come right up to dock. You can also bring your pets! In fact, I saw one guy who brought his parakeet on his shoulder! lol we had some tasty frozen drinks, that either hid the alcohol taste very well with all the sweetness or it was lacking enough alcohol. I'm not sure which, but kinda leaning towards the latter. They have a few beers on tap, but may not be familiar with them. For example, our waitress didn't know that there are several types of Sam Adams beers when I asked which one was on tap. I had the stuffed flounder for my main course and ate every bite. However, I could have been better with less sauce on it. My stomach hurt from all that afterwards I think. We tried the fried cheesecake for dessert...it was okay. Nothing exciting. If you're looking for a leisurely dinner outside while enjoying the Florida atmosphere, this is your place. I wouldn't say no to going back!\n",

      "Now, read and process the review: \"So good that we came here twice and bought a t-shirt\" This was probably one of the top 3 restaurants for my wife and I. We visited twice and can understand the hype. From the service to the food: amazing! Ambience: Hipster? Small amount of seating. Fits 40ish people. Eclectic. Star wars memorabilia dressed with random costumes and items. Yoda riding a unicorn. That sums it up. Clean and organized.Pricing: Quality at the right price. They are not throwing huge portions at you, but you are not getting ripped off. You're getting what you pay for. Reminder: they take the time to craft your food which means love and care was added. Worth it. Food: You order at the counter and hopefully you can find a seat after. Thankfully the selection is enough where you don't feel overwhelmed. This adds to the wait in line. Get what you know you love. You won't be disappointed. You don't have to follow what people suggest unless you guys have similar palettes. Charcuterie board 5/5I love cured meats and they do a great job of providing a decent selection of what they make themselves. 3 salamis and 2 tourines. You get chow chow (pickled onions and peppers) delish, a great deli mustard, and their house pickles. (My wife and I are addicted to these) it comes with flat bread crackers. Had this twice. Le pig mac 10/5. This sandwich exceeded what we read and have experienced out of anything we have eaten similar to this. It is two pork sausage patties with their amazing pickles, shredded lettuce, and amazing house sauce. It reminds you of a big Mac but without the negatives. Lol. My wife and I shared this behemoth. It is that huge. Coconut tart 4/5. My wife enjoyed the crust but stated the filling was a bit sweet for her. Mind you, a dessert for her needs balance while others may prefer decadence. It looked amazing and enticing. It says something about a place if they put proper care in the crust. Hot boudin 3/5. We had ordered this as a side to what we were eating. We were not expecting much. We ordered it because we wanted something that was native to the area. It's basically sausage with rice in it. It comes with their amazing pickles and must have mustard. We only ate the inside because the casing was not appealing to eat. It was only warmed through and meant to hold the filling which was good. Having it once was enough for us. Drink: I love drinking and consider my pallete to be pretty broad. I do have my preferences and things I'll look for. We were very lucky the day that we visited that they were serving Great Raft brewery. From what I've read and was told it is one of they great micro brews they have in the state of Louisiana. That's something to experience and boy were they on to something. I'm from the west coast and our beers tend to be hoppy and light bodied. We'll get some porters and stouts but they generally aren't typical. Baltic porter 5/5. Saison 4.5/5. Whoopsy daisy 5/5. Wife doesn't generally drink but enjoyed this and ordered it again. This tells me that it was easy and fun to drink. That is what she enjoys. Service: What I have noticed from my 10 days in nola that most restaurants will have a team of people that are taking care of you and at butcher this is no exception. They exceeded and welcomed us as travelers and not as tourists. We enjoyed some great conversations about the beers and they are very open about talking about life after the storm. They shared about the healing was happening and the community that came together and built everything back up. They spoke extremely well of chef Donald link (co owner) which speaks to the gratitude and loyalty they have to one another. It makes for a great place and a great environment to eat and be a part of. 10/5 Hashtag: #amustreturn #hugepartofnolalife #foodieheaven\n"

We visited twice and can understand the hype. From the service to the food: amazing! Ambience: Hipster? Small amount of seating. Fits 40ish people. Eclectic. Star wars memorabilia dressed with random costumes and items. Yoda riding a unicorn. That sums it up. Clean and organized.Pricing: Quality at the right price. They are not throwing huge portions at you, but you are not getting ripped off. You\\'re getting what you pay for. Reminder: they take the time to craft your food which means love and care was added. Worth it. Food: You order at the counter and hopefully you can find a seat after. Thankfully the selection is enough where you don\\'t feel overwhelmed. This adds to the wait in line. Get what you know you love. You won\\'t be disappointed. You don\\'t have to follow what people suggest unless you guys have similar palettes. Charcuterie board 5/5I love cured meats and they do a great job of providing a decent selection of what they make themselves. 3 salamis and 2 tourines. You get chow chow (pickled onions and peppers) delish, a great deli mustard, and their house pickles. (My wife and I are addicted to these) it comes with flat bread crackers. Had this twice. Le pig mac 10/5. This sandwich exceeded what we read and have experienced out of anything we have eaten similar to this. It is two pork sausage patties with their amazing pickles, shredded lettuce, and amazing house sauce. It reminds you of a big Mac but without the negatives. Lol. My wife and I shared this behemoth. It is that huge. Coconut tart 4/5. My wife enjoyed the crust but stated the filling was a bit sweet for her. Mind you, a dessert for her needs balance while others may prefer decadence. It looked amazing and enticing. It says something about a place if they put proper care in the crust. Hot boudin 3/5. We had ordered this as a side to what we were eating. We were not expecting much. We ordered it because we wanted something that was native to the area. It\\'s basically sausage with rice in it. It comes with their amazing pickles and must have mustard. We only ate the inside because the casing was not appealing to eat. It was only warmed through and meant to hold the filling which was good. Having it once was enough for us. Drink: I love drinking and consider my pallete to be pretty broad. I do have my preferences and things I\\'ll look for. We were very lucky the day that we visited that they were serving Great Raft brewery. From what I\\'ve read and was told it is one of they great micro brews they have in the state of Louisiana. That\\'s something to experience and boy were they on to something. I\\'m from the west coast and our beers tend to be hoppy and light bodied. We\\'ll get some porters and stouts but they generally aren\\'t typical. Baltic porter 5/5. Saison 4.5/5. Whoopsy daisy 5/5. Wife doesn\\'t generally drink but enjoyed this and ordered it again.

      "Really good sushi - in a strip mall in Bristol. Go figure. They have hibachi as well, but I feel like hibachi food is hibachi food no matter where you go; it's more about the performance. Do it once and then keep coming back for the sushi! This is a mom-and-pop type restaurant with a friendly atmosphere. If you're there for a special occasion, they'll take a polaroid and add it to their wall. I have fond memories of many family meals here. Look for my picture on the wall; I'm the adorable one.\n",

We visited twice and can understand the hype. From the service to the food: amazing! Ambience: Hipster? Small amount of seating. Fits 40ish people. Eclectic. Star wars memorabilia dressed with random costumes and items. Yoda riding a unicorn. That sums it up. Clean and organized.Pricing: Quality at the right price. They are not throwing huge portions at you, but you are not getting ripped off. You\\'re getting what you pay for. Reminder: they take the time to craft your food which means love and care was added. Worth it. Food: You order at the counter and hopefully you can find a seat after. Thankfully the selection is enough where you don\\'t feel overwhelmed. This adds to the wait in line. Get what you know you love. You won\\'t be disappointed. You don\\'t have to follow what people suggest unless you guys have similar palettes. Charcuterie board 5/5I love cured meats and they do a great job of providing a decent selection of what they make themselves. 3 salamis and 2 tourines. You get chow chow (pickled onions and peppers) delish, a great deli mustard, and their house pickles. (My wife and I are addicted to these) it comes with flat bread crackers. Had this twice. Le pig mac 10/5. This sandwich exceeded what we read and have experienced out of anything we have eaten similar to this. It is two pork sausage patties with their amazing pickles, shredded lettuce, and amazing house sauce. It reminds you of a big Mac but without the negatives. Lol. My wife and I shared this behemoth. It is that huge. Coconut tart 4/5. My wife enjoyed the crust but stated the filling was a bit sweet for her. Mind you, a dessert for her needs balance while others may prefer decadence. It looked amazing and enticing. It says something about a place if they put proper care in the crust. Hot boudin 3/5. We had ordered this as a side to what we were eating. We were not expecting much. We ordered it because we wanted something that was native to the area. It\\'s basically sausage with rice in it. It comes with their amazing pickles and must have mustard. We only ate the inside because the casing was not appealing to eat. It was only warmed through and meant to hold the filling which was good. Having it once was enough for us. Drink: I love drinking and consider my pallete to be pretty broad. I do have my preferences and things I\\'ll look for. We were very lucky the day that we visited that they were serving Great Raft brewery. From what I\\'ve read and was told it is one of they great micro brews they have in the state of Louisiana. That\\'s something to experience and boy were they on to something. I\\'m from the west coast and our beers tend to be hoppy and light bodied. We\\'ll get some porters and stouts but they generally aren\\'t typical. Baltic porter 5/5. Saison 4.5/5. Whoopsy daisy 5/5. Wife doesn\\'t generally drink but enjoyed this and ordered it again. This tells me that it was easy and fun to drink. That is what she enjoys. Service: What I have noticed from my 10 days in nola that most restaurants will have a team of people that are taking care of you and at butcher this is no exception. They exceeded and welcomed us as travelers and not as tourists. We enjoyed some great conversations about the beers and they are very open about talking about life after the storm. They shared about the healing was happening and the community that came together and built everything back up. They spoke extremely well of chef Donald link (co owner) which speaks to the gratitude and loyalty they have to one another.

Their happy hour special is unbeatable, they have a good selection of draft beers, and the food is out of this world good. The stand out feature of upper deck is the offering of life size beer pong at their outside patio. This takes traditional beer pong and substitutes solo cups with garbage cans (painted to look like solo cups) and Ping Pong balls with dodgeballs They also have a pool table and recently added arcade games (nfl blitz 99 beats madden 15 all day).

      "Really good sushi - in a strip mall in Bristol. Go figure. They have hibachi as well, but I feel like hibachi food is hibachi food no matter where you go; it's more about the performance. Do it once and then keep coming back for the sushi! This is a mom-and-pop type restaurant with a friendly atmosphere. If you're there for a special occasion, they'll take a polaroid and add it to their wall. I have fond memories of many family meals here. Look for my picture on the wall; I'm the adorable one.\n",

      "A bit high priced, and the food is overall good, but not amazing. Still, I really enjoyed myself here probably because I just love sitting at a place on the water (even if the road is right nearby). The place seems large and mostly outdoors. It's a casual fun atmosphere and boaters can come right up to dock. You can also bring your pets! In fact, I saw one guy who brought his parakeet on his shoulder! lol we had some tasty frozen drinks, that either hid the alcohol taste very well with all the sweetness or it was lacking enough alcohol. I'm not sure which, but kinda leaning towards the latter. They have a few beers on tap, but may not be familiar with them. For example, our waitress didn't know that there are several types of Sam Adams beers when I asked which one was on tap. I had the stuffed flounder for my main course and ate every bite. However, I could have been better with less sauce on it. My stomach hurt from all that afterwards I think. We tried the fried cheesecake for dessert...it was okay. Nothing exciting. If you're looking for a leisurely dinner outside while enjoying the Florida atmosphere, this is your place. I wouldn't say no to going back!\n",

      "Now, read and process the review: After being in the restaurant business my entire life, this is a hidden gem... It is a not just a steak house, its extraordinary with ever angle of perfection.. I have never sat at a dinner table when the entrees came and literally no one spoke while eating, for a crazy long amount of time, until one of my guests said, \"This might be the best steak i have EVER had.\" There were 6 of us. Each having a different appetizer, and a different entree, (we are ALL foodies), and very helpful suggestions from our completely professional server Peter. I had the special mussel appetizer, they were plump and plentiful, and a tantalizing pork chop cooked to perfection. My husband (the birthday boy) had a butcher block consisting 16 oz ribeye, (he substituted for the filet), 6 oz broiled lobster tail, jumbo shrimp and colossal crabmeat and broiled scallops. We had a bottle of Cane and Fable for the table, at Peter's suggestion, a perfect choice. Everything, including the bread was delicious. This place isn't just for special occasions, we were made aware of the various specials throughout the week that. They offer... A DEFINITE MUST... And then we ended our evening next door at their sister restaurant for after dinner cocktails and a lively fun band as well !!!!\n"
