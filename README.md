# Engineering Serendipity through Recommendations of Items with Atypical Aspects
A restaurant dinner or a hotel stay may lead to memorable experiences when guests encounter unexpected aspects that also match their interests. For example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper crafts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce the new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with atypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to rerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect utility values. We also introduce a custom procedure for dynamic selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based judgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. 

# Atypical Aspect-Based Recommender System (ATARS)
This repository contains the source code and datasets for Atypical Aspect-Based Recommender System (ATARS) as described in the paper. ["Engineering Serendipity through Recommendations of Items with Atypical Aspects"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23580) currently under review at ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems.

Example interaction with the proposed recommender system, where items with atypical aspects relevant to the user are promoted at the top of the ranking (before), in order to engineer a serendipitous experience (after).
